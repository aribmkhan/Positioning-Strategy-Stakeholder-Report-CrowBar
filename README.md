This project aims to assess how customers perceive CrowBar compared to four competing bars by analyzing survey data on eight bar attributes. Using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), my study identifies which attributes most differentiate the bars and how CrowBar is positioned within this competitive landscape. The findings guide strategic recommendations to improve CrowBarâ€™s market appeal and competitive strategy.
